delegateSetupStepForm_k8sConfigDetails.namespace:
    content: |
        By default, the Delegate resides in a namespace in the target cluster with a service account attached to it. The service account uses a **ClusterRole** for permission to deploy to all namespaces in the cluster.

        This centralized model is simple and efficient, but does not let you restrict deployments to specific namespaces. Any team member can deploy to any namespace.

        You can instead use a distributed model that installs a delegate in a specific namespace. This technique limits the delegate to deploying into its own namespace. 

        When you add a Harness Kubernetes Cluster Connector to the cluster, you can use a service account in that namespace with the Cluster Admin role. [Learn More](https://docs.harness.io/article/1gaud2efd4)

    AutoStopping Rules make sure that your non-production resources run only when used, and never when idle:
    - Automatically detect idle times and shut down (on-demand) or terminate (spot) resources.
    - Automatically restart resources whenever there is traffic or usage requests.
    - Stopped/terminated machines are always accessible using the same access patterns that the team is used to – DNS link, SSH, RDP, background tasks.
    - Enable running workloads on fully-orchestrated spot instances without worrying about spot interruptions.

    To configure AutoStopping Rules, you first need to create a connector to connect Harness to your account and then create AutoStopping Rules.


    Connectors allow Harness to connect to your deployment environments, such as Kubernetes Clusters, AWS, Google Cloud Platform, Azure, etc. For more information, see the following topics:
    - [Create an AWS Connector for AutoStopping Rules](https://docs.harness.io/article/hiyi6xvj36)
    - [Create an Azure Connector for AutoStopping Rules](https://docs.harness.io/article/e7yidxmtmj)


    Once you have connected your cloud account to Harness, create intelligent AutoStopping Rules to optimize your cloud costs. For more information, see the following topics:
    - [Create AutoStopping Rules for AWS](https://docs.harness.io/article/7025n9ml7z)

        - With **Regex** selected, the regex `todolist-v\d.\d` will match.

        If the regex expression does not result in a match, Harness ignores the value.

        Harness supports standard Java regex. For example, if Regex is enabled and the intent is to match any branch, the wildcard should be `.*` instead of simply a wildcard `*`. If you wanted to match all of the files that end in `-DEV.tar` you would enter `.*-DEV\.tar`.

SecretsListViewname:

        Harness includes a built-in Secrets Management feature that enables you to store encrypted secrets, such as access keys, and use them in your Harness account. 

        Some key points about Secrets Management:

        - Secrets are always stored in encrypted form and decrypted when they are needed.
        - Harness Manager does not have access to your key management system, and only the Harness Delegate, which sits in your private network, has access to it. Harness never makes secrets management accessible publicly. This adds an important layer of security.
        - You can connect Harness with your own secrets management tools, or use the built-in Harness Secrets Manager.

portBindings:
    content: |
        When a Pipeline runs on an AWS build farm, some Steps might run on a bare metal VM and others run in a container. The port used to communicate with the Service Dependency depends on where the Step is running: bare-metal Steps use the Host Port and containerized Steps use the Container Port. 

        Suppose you create a Service Dependency with the Name and Id **myloginservice**. 
        - A containerized Step talks to the service using **myloginservice:_container_port_**. 
        - A  Run or Run Test Step that runs directly on the VM talks to the service using **localhost:_host_port_**.

        The binding of Host and Container Ports is similar to [port mapping in Docker](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/container-networking/). Usually the ports are the same unless the default Host Port for the service dependency is already in use by another local service.

depth:
    content: |
        The number of commits to fetch when Harness clones a repo.

        - For manual Builds, when a user clicks **Build** in the Harness UI, the default Depth is 50 (each `git clone` operation fetches the most recent 50 commits). A setting of 0 fetches all commits in the branch.
        - For triggered Builds, the default Depth is 0 (fetch all commits to the branch).

        For details, see [https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone).
    width: "400"
prCloneStrategy:
    content: |
        When a build is triggered by a pull request, this setting determines the branch to use for the artifact after the build process clones the repo.

        - If **Merge Commit** (the default) is selected, the Pipeline tries to merge the Pull Request branch with the target branch before building the artifact. The artifact includes all PR and target commits, but builds can take longer and result in build failures.
        - If **Source Branch** is selected, the Pipeline builds the artifact from the latest commit in the Pull Request branch. Builds can be faster and less likely to result in build failures, but the artifacts might not include some target-branch commits.

        - **Heartbeats:** running Delegates send heartbeats to the Harness Manager in 1 minute intervals. If the Manager does not have a heartbeat for a Delegate when a task is ready to be assigned, it will not assign the task to that Delegate.

        - **Tags:** see [Select Delegates with Tags](https://newdocs.helpdocs.io/article/nnuf8yv13o).

        - **Allowlisting:** once a Delegate has been validated for a task, it is allowlisted for that task and will likely be used again for that task. The allowlisting criteria is the URL associated with the task, such as a connection to a cloud platform, repo, or API. A Delegate is allowlisted for all tasks using that URL. The Time-To-Live (TTL) for the allowlisting is 6 hours, and the TTL is reset with each successful task validation.

        - **Blocklisting:** if a Delegate fails to perform a task that Delegate is blocklisted for that task and will not be tried again. TTL is 5 minutes. This is true if there is only one Delegate and even if the Delegate is selected for that task with a Selector.

                You reference the **Provisioner Identifier** in other steps to refer to the provisioning done by this step.
                The most common use of **Provisioner Identifier** is between the Create Stack, Delete Stack, and Rollback Stack steps.
                For example, in the case of a Create Stack failure, the Rollback Stack step rolls back the provisioning from the Create Stack step using its **Provisioner Identifier**.
                **Note:** Only one **Create Stack** step with a specific **Provisioner Identifier** can be added in the same stage. If you add multiple Create Stack steps with the same **Provisioner Identifier**, only the first Create Stack step will be successful.
                ### Provisioner Identifier Scope
                The Provisioner Identifier is a Project-wide setting. You can reference it across Pipelines in the same Project.
                For this reason, it's important that all your Project members know the Provisioner Identifiers. This will prevent one member building a Pipeline from accidentally impacting the provisioning of another member's Pipeline.

                The **Provisioner Identifier** identifies the stack provisioned by this step. 
                You reference the **Provisioner Identifier** in other steps to refer to the provisioning done by this step.
                The most common use of **Provisioner Identifier** is between the Create Stack, Delete Stack, and Rollback Stack steps.
                For example, in the case of a Create Stack failure, the Rollback Stack step rolls back the provisioning from the Create Stack step using its **Provisioner Identifier**.
                **Note:** Only one **Create Stack** step with a specific **Provisioner Identifier** can be added in the same stage. If you add multiple Create Stack steps with the same **Provisioner Identifier**, only the first Create Stack step will be successful.
                ### Provisioner Identifier Scope
                The Provisioner Identifier is a Project-wide setting. You can reference it across Pipelines in the same Project.
                For this reason, it's important that all your Project members know the Provisioner Identifiers. This will prevent one member building a Pipeline from accidentally impacting the provisioning of another member's Pipeline.

The Connector uses the cluster master URL and an auth method such as a Kubernetes service account or it inherits credentials from a Harness Delegate running in your infrastructure.

        #### Cloud Provider
        A connection to the cloud platform where your cluster is hosted, such as GKE on GCP. It uses a platform [Cloud Connector](https://docs.harness.io/category/1ehb4tcksy) to connect to the cluster.

        The Wait step pauses the pipeline execution for any amount of time. After the wait time expires, the pipeline execution proceeds. [Learn More](https://developer.harness.io/docs/continuous-delivery/cd-execution/cd-general-steps/wait-step/)

        When the Wait step is running, it provides the following options in the pipeline execution page:

        - **Mark as Success**. Ends the wait period and proceeds with the execution. 
        - **Mark as Failed**. Initiates the [failure strategy](https://developer.harness.io/docs/platform/pipelines/define-a-failure-strategy-on-stages-and-steps/) for the step or stage, if any, or simply fails the execution.

        Here are the minimal permissions that the ServiceNow user account (set in the Harness ServiceNow Connector) must have for executing a ServiceNow import set step:

        - `import_transformer`.
        - Role mapping to CRUD permissions on staging table.
        - Role mapping to READ permissions for each of the target tables that have an existing transform map from the specified staging table to the target table.
        - (If required) permissions for fetching specific staging tables.
        - Permission to access table `sys_db_object`. This is optional because you can enter your own staging table instead of selecting prefetched values.

        For example, to initiate a transformation using the `sys_import_state_comment` field of the selected staging table based on its transformation map, you would use something like this:

        ```
        {"sys_import_state_comment":"my comment"}
        ```

        You can also use Harness [runtime inputs, variable expressions](https://developer.harness.io/docs/platform/references/runtime-inputs/), and Harness secrets in the JSON of JSON Body.

        For example, you could create a stage variable named `importset` and then reference it in JSON Body as `{"u_example":"<+stage.variables.importset>"}`.
